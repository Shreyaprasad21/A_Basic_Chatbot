# chatbot
The code creates a chatbot using NLTK for sentiment analysis and TF-IDF for word embedding. It reads and visualizes dialogues, performs text normalization, and employs cosine similarity to match user queries with dataset responses. The chatbot handles low-confidence cases and allows user interaction until typing 'exit.'
